# District.jl

A stochastic optimization library for district microgrids.


District.jl is a modeling and optimization library, aiming at
applying stochastic optimization algorithms to the control
of local microgrids. The three components of District are:

- A modeling tool to build easily optimization model;
- A set of optimization algorithms to solve these optimization models;
- A simulator to fairly assess the different strategies.
